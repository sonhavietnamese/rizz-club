## Problems

- Content creators don’t own their audience.
- They depend on social media platforms and their algorithms to distribute content and maintain reach. When algorithms change, creators lose visibility, engagement, and even their fanbase.

- Existing “link-in-bio” tools only aggregate links.
- They don’t create interaction, community, or ownership.
- Creators still lack a direct, durable relationship with their fans—and fans remain passive consumers.
